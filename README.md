## Hey! Listen!

This is a repo for the Navi slackbot. 

As of right now, Navi only works as a function of user-calls. 

To start navi, simply invite her to a channel and use the command `@Navi start`. She will then randomly select a user from the channel and ask them for a Spotify/YouTube links. Navi will then post that link to the channel where the command was issued. Support for other kinds of links can be added if requested. 

Future plans for Navi:

* get Navi to initiate her link requesting/sharing herself on a schedule
* graceful handling for unresponsive users
* ability to exclude certain users from random selection (e.g., marked as away users)
* storage and querying of link history (maybe some SQLite)


**Have fun!**
